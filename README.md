### Bluetooth Light Switch

A program created for a bluetooth-controlled (via an HC-05 module) wireless light switch built using the Arduino platform. 
The light switch utilizes two servo motors, which flip the light switch on and off. 


**Step 1:** Attach the two servos to ports 12 and 13.

**Step 2:** Attach the HC-05 module to the respective ports, TX and RX.

**Step 3:** Download the Bluetooth.apk file on Android or create your own program.

**Step 4:** Download and upload the Bluetooth_Servo_Control.ino file to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

**Step 5:** Connect your device to the HC-05 module after holding down the reset button. 


**Note:** The HC-05 module is currently not compatible with IOS devices due to MFi Licensing issues.
